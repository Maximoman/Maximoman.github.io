<p>Universal traits and connections</p>
<h3>Factions and other organizations</h3>
<h4>The Echos֎</h4>
<p>Forgotten are the incarnation of all that is lost and alone. They are involved with many powerful beings in the multiverse and oversee a multitude of projects.</p>
<p>The Enclave of Sound is the organization of Knight Resonators; Knight Resonators are the elite of the people, often from humble beginnings who have trained under the careful watch of the Council of Echos, the best of the best, to let sound permeate their body and spirit in such a way that they can shape the fabric of reality through that connection: magic. The Enclave has only stood as a formal organization for three decades but the Resonators themselves have existed for millenia.</p>
<p>The Cult of the Silent was once known as a faction of Resonators who specialized in strange spells that required no verbal incantation. Then, at a time before history was written a crazed Resonator decimated and reorganized their order into a separate organization bent on bringing peace and eternal silence to everything, by any means necessary.</p>
<h4>The Clans</h4>
<p>The Bloodstone Clan</p>
<p>The Landflow Clan</p>
<p>The Treespire Clan</p>
<h4>The Tribes</h4>
<p>Emerald Echos</p>
<p>Amethyst Archive</p>
<p>Garnet Glade</p>
<h4>The Kingdoms</h4>
<p>Teslerax</p>
<p>Zeadrodalar</p>
<p>Miammeoxus</p>
A kingdom allied with Teslerax, Miammeoxus is a beacon of hope to those far from the safety of home. A very peaceful and benevolent king rules here and he encourages individual thought and creativity, he has banned slavery and all forms of punishment that discouraged creativity. The king is also powerfully focused on sustainability, as unclaimed land is quickly disappearing. Quite the scholar he began to establish greenbelts and nature reserves, he also employed wizards to replenish normally non-renewable resources.
<p>The Void Dominion</p>
<p>The king of the Void Dominion keeps his subjects in check by keeping them ignorant and focused on facts, he removes their ability to have faith and therefore halts them from believing that there is anything other than what they can prove with the facts they are given, manipulating truth into a cage that holds all creativity and original thought at bay. The Void Dominion is constantly expanding and invading as their king longs for more to come under his power, he is a greedy son of a motherless goat who cares nothing for the individual and sees the world as groups that he can destroy and pillage. It is rumored that he uses Heart §ingers to control the hearts of the people, though this theory has no grounds.
<h3>Characters</h3>
<p>Broken</p>
<p>One forgotten who is constantly spasming in pain and whose touch claims all hope and joy of them who are touched. It became such a destructive creature that it was locked in an impenetrable vault but even that can't contain it's power. The most disturbing part of the forgotten is that most of them were once people before they were transformed into destructive entities.</p>
<p>Tyrathus the Fallen</p>
<p>Once one of the Knight Resonators, his final living relative and only friend was murdered in cold blood and Tyrathus blamed the Silent Order for not protecting him and shattered their order. In the pit of his dispare he saw hope; to bring the silent suffering he felt inside to every being in existence. He reforged the Silent Order into a tool that he weilds with impunity.</p>
<p>Sazzalthra, Queen of the Dragons</p>
<p>After the fall of Tiamat, Sazzalthra eased the dragon's anguish by slaying a horde of demons partly responsible for her death and claimed the dragon queen's throne. After doing this she vowed to bring justice to all who aided in the death of Tiamat and is on a crusade to slay all enemies of dragons. She is quick to anger and equally quick in wit, quick to laugh and quick to obliterate all who stand in her way.</p>
<p>Truthblade the Outcast</p>
<p>Having suffered three traitors to escape with their lives and claiming that the criminals were innocent he was abandoned by the only people he knew outside his family and is now on a quest to find an artifact that will redeem him in the eyes of his people. He believes that truth is a great virtue and will never lie or bend words, speaking plainly even if his life is on the line.</p>
<p>Edwin Lycurgas, New Age Champion</p>
<p>Elected as the new king of Miammeoxus he began to study the many secrets of the plain and eventually found a way to alter the direction of time relative to other plains and as his final days approached, he left Miammeoxus and his final days became is first. Now wandering this plain he has begun to study magic and its many applications.</p>
<p>Qaphsiel, First Ascendant of the Avengers</p>
<p>Once a human devoted to an oath of justice he fulfilled his oath and in doing so was blessed with an ascended form. He remembers little but knows that he must protect the weak and bring justice to the evil.</p>
<p>Jerados Stone</p>
<p>When the greatest catastrophe the multiverse has ever known destroyed his home, Jerados Stone was thrown through the fabric of reality and glimpsed the whole of everything all within the point of his eye, infinitely detailed and intricate he saw the alignment of everything, before he was ripped back to reality and ever since his eyes have been scarred with a ringlet of gold inscribed into his iris. He then devoted himself to collecting knowledge for the purpose of aligning the pieces of reality that were blown apart.</p>
<h3>Roles and professions</h3>
<p>Basic Professions are professions that are very common in most planes, they include blacksmiths, weavers, tailors, cooks, innkeepers, barmaids, really any job that is not magic related and is found in nearly all realms.</p>
<p>A Heart §inger is a singer by trade that has incorporated magic into their singing, the basest of Heart §ingers are merely storytellers that bring their stories to life in the sences of the audicence and weaving elaborate tales. However, the least common and most powerful of Heart §ingers are much more than frivolous storytellers, they are trained to the point of uncanny ability, being able to read the hearts and intents of those around them and alter them through singing and telling, making them able to change the nature of those around them and the very best can even bring into being unimaginable horrors and magnificent wonders that are rooted in the hearts of villians and heros. This profession is widely looked down upon and parents often tell their children myths that blame a Heart §inger for the creation of the Forgotten.</p>
<p>Talon Forger</p>
<p>Jewel Weaver</p>
<p>Metal Weaver</p>
<p>Stone Shaman</p>
<p>A Knight Resonator is A knight of Teslerax, Zeadrodalar, The void dominion or Miammeoxus who has trained to become a mighty warrior in the ways of sound. They have become so integrated into sound that it is a fundamental part of their physical body.</p>
