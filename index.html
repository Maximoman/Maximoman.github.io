<p>The Enclave of Sound is the organization of Knight Resonators; Knight Resonators are the elite of the people, often from humble beginnings who have trained under the careful watch of the Council of Echos, the best of the best, to let sound permeate their body and spirit in such a way that they can shape the fabric of reality through that connection: magic. The Enclave has only stood as a formal organization for three decades but the Resonators themselves have existed for millenia.</p>
<p>The Cult of the Silent was once known as a faction of Resonators who specialized in strange spells that required no verbal incantation.
