<p>Welcome to the homepage, I will possibly put notes here for future referance.</p>
<p>The sonorous realm, as this plane is called, is in a very strange position in relation to others: it sits in the fabric of space and is only reachable by way of resonant portals formed by coalesced sound from surrounding planes, this makes access to the sonorous plane sporadic and unreliable. Another strange factor of the plane is that it's direction in time in relation to the rest of existence is maliable, allowing many strange events to occur such as heros saving a time before they were born and also leads to unpredictable consequences.</p>
