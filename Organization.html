<!--Organization notes-->
<h3>Factions and other organizations</h3>
<h4>The Echos֎</h4>
<p>Forgotten are the incarnation of all that is lost and alone. They are involved with many powerful beings in the multiverse and oversee a multitude of projects.</p>
<p>The Enclave of Sound is the organization of Knight Resonators; Knight Resonators are the elite of the people, often from humble beginnings who have trained under the careful watch of the Council of Echos, the best of the best, to let sound permeate their body and spirit in such a way that they can shape the fabric of reality through that connection: magic. The Enclave has only stood as a formal organization for three decades but the Resonators themselves have existed for millenia.</p>
<p>The Cult of the Silent was once known as a faction of Resonators who specialized in strange spells that required no verbal incantation. Then, at a time before history was written a crazed Resonator decimated and reorganized their order into a separate organization bent on bringing peace and eternal silence to everything, by any means necessary.</p>
<h4>The Clans</h4>
<p>The Bloodstone Clan</p>
<p>The Landflow Clan</p>
<p>The Treespire Clan</p>
<h4>The Tribes</h4>
<p>Emerald Echos</p>
<p>Amethyst Archive</p>
<p>Garnet Glade</p>
<h4>The Kingdoms</h4>
<p>Teslerax</p>
<p>Zeadrodalar</p>
<p>Miammeoxus</p>
<p>A kingdom allied with Teslerax, Miammeoxus is a beacon of hope to those far from the safety of home. A very peaceful and benevolent king rules here and he encourages individual thought and creativity, he has banned slavery and all forms of punishment that discouraged creativity. The king is also powerfully focused on sustainability, as unclaimed land is quickly disappearing. Quite the scholar he began to establish greenbelts and nature reserves, he also employed wizards to replenish normally non-renewable resources.</p>
<p>The Void Dominion</p>
<p>The king of the Void Dominion keeps his subjects in check by keeping them ignorant and focused on facts, he removes their ability to have faith and therefore halts them from believing that there is anything other than what they can prove with the facts they are given, manipulating truth into a cage that holds all creativity and original thought at bay. The Void Dominion is constantly expanding and invading as their king longs for more to come under his power, he is a greedy son of a motherless goat who cares nothing for the individual and sees the world as groups that he can destroy and pillage. It is rumored that he uses Heart §ingers to control the hearts of the people, though this theory has no grounds.
