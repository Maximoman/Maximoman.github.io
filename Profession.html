<p>Basic Professions are professions that are very common in most planes, they include blacksmiths, weavers, tailors, cooks, innkeepers, barmaids, really any job that is not magic related and is found in nearly all realms.</p>
<p>A Heart §inger is a singer by trade that has incorporated magic into their singing, the basest of Heart §ingers are merely storytellers that bring their stories to life in the senses of the audicence and weaving elaborate tales. However, the least common and most powerful of Heart §ingers are much more than frivolous storytellers, they are trained to the point of uncanny ability, being able to read the hearts and intents of those around them and alter them through singing and telling, making them able to change the nature of those around them and the very best can even bring into being unimaginable horrors and magnificent wonders that are rooted in the hearts of villians and heros. This profession is widely looked down upon and parents often tell their children myths that blame a Heart §inger for the creation of the Forgotten.</p>

In the case of infusing an object it gains magical resonance and properties based upon the spell.

There are dire consequences for even the slightest mishap in the process, for both the weaver and the subject. </p>
