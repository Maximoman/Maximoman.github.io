<h3>World</h3>
<p>The only continent I have documented in the Sonorous Realm is Audirox, and after I finish writing my observations and discoveries I plan to travel to the others, known as Esileron, Barasea and the Archipelago of Vutira.</p>
<p>The Onyx Abyss</p>
<p>Magics</p>
<p>The Sonorous realm is magic in nature and therefore has countless magical happenings, thus prohibiting me from detailing all of the magical happenings but I will explain the most prominent and explainable of these magics as best I can.</p>
<p>The most prominent 6 magics are as follows: Modulation, Incantation, Optic, Taction, Reticent and Wild magic. Modulation is used primarily for instant spells. Incantation is used for enchantment and warding. Optic is the most complicated and mystical. Taction is the most common and simple magic; being based on touch. Reticent is the cursed art of silent magic. Wild magic is the categorization of natural magic that takes effect "randomly", usually in nature.</p>
<p>Modulation is the use of magic through sound, it is the most straightforward; a specific sound will always create the same effect. The main principle of modulation is that if you can make a sound, you can cast a spell. Modulation has four elements: Intensity, Tempo, Reliability and Flow. Intensity controls the power of the spell and typically makes the spell's effects more fiery. Tempo controls the speed at which the spell is cast and usually makes the spell more airy. Reliability controls the stability of and length of the spell's effects as well as makes the spell more solid. Flow is your ability to merge and manipulate spells and link unrelated sounds to form cohesive spells, it makes spells more watery. </p>
<p>Incantation is considered by many to be a subcategory of Modulation as it has the same elements. I will list it as seperate because it has different principles. The Principles of incantation are based upon the sound conductivity of the object the spell is being cast upon.</p>
<p>Optic magic is less defined than most magics as some consider the reading of another person through eye contact to fit here while others see it as a natural humanoid ability. Optic magic is conducted through sight and eye contact. I have done little study on this division of magic and therefore don't have much to say about it.</p>
<p>Taction</p>
<p>Reticent</p>
<p>Wild</p>
<p>Landscape and enviornment</p>
<p>The most considerable difference between other planes and the Sonorous Realm is that because the way the world was created, it's fundimental principle is that sound is the primary sense. Many of the pigments in organic matter only reveal themselves when affected by sound. This leaves the world dry and blank in silence. It also makes places of much noise burst with color and action. Organisms are structured to react to sounds and depend heavily upon it for survival. Unlike most other planes, vision is trumped by hearing. Light, magic and health are measured through sound rather than sight, cities have security persons listen instead of watch. Communication is structurally different in that body language is nearly completely ignored and the true intentions of a person are revealed as they speak unless they have trained to manipulate their voices with magic due to the innate underlying sounds.</p>
<p>One quirk of the Sonorous Realm is that due to the way it formed metal is both very rare and valuable. It's applications in magic are nearly limitless and it's natural formation almost nonexistent.</p>
