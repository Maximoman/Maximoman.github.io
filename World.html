<h3>World</h3>
<p>Magics</p>
<p>The Sonorous realm is magic in nature and therefore has countless magical happenings, thus prohibiting me from detailing all of the magical happenings but I will explain the most prominent and explainable of these magics as best I can.</p>
<p>The most prominent 6 magics are as follows: Modulation, Incantation, Optic, Taction, Reticent and Wild magic. Modulation is used primarily for instant spells. Incantation is used for enchantment and warding. Optic is the most complicated and mystical. Taction is the most common and simple magic; being based on touch. Reticent is the cursed art of silent magic. Wild magic is the categorization of natural magic that takes effect "randomly", usually in nature.</p>
