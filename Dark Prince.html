With the seeming end of the cataclysmic destruction of the storms of fire, ice and crystal, the people of Acreon begin to heal, many of the surviving rural communities are flocking to citadels, massive sanctuary cities, as farming and ranching have suffered greatly. Among the refugees are a strange group: an undead crusader, a gunslinging adventurer and their ragged companions. When they arrive at the citadel they make camp and consume the last of their rations. As the sun rises over the misty landscape the following day the group strives to get their first glimpse of the Citadel... 

After Vyndrel Quantive the gunslinger and the Red Duke arrived at the primary citadel they found a mysterious woman who gave them blessings and curses as well as granted them entry to the citadel. Inside they found that their noble estates were in ruin and with their dwindling funds they were forced to work at the "Cursed Sword" a well run tavern in the workman's sector. After seeing the dominant religion of fanatics, known as "The Order", they became involved with the Syndicate and in doing so rediscovered a friend, the Silvermantle, and obtained a few resources which they used much of to establish a mercenary guild/headquarters... 

With a flourishing business/mercenary group established and a mysterious secretary hired, ᛋᛈᚺᛁᚾᚼ, Vyndrel and Red were given an opportunity to assassinate some members of high society in a mission from the syndicate. They failed to kill any of their three targets but identified Sigmund, Singrel, Singress and a few other nobles. Notably they met Ashriel who saved Red's life and Vyndrel identified as his foul enemy. The syndicate failed to eliminate the duo as a contingency plan and is now carefully watching them. With their guild off the ground they have decided to accept a quest to Formless Reach... 

Vyndrel and Red were suprised by what they found at Formless Reach: two otherworldly visitors; A short teifling named Damakos Reijin as well as a dwarf named Flint Fireforge. With their new companions they searched through the everchanging manor until they found a cavern filled with mimic like beings that turned to dust when struck, after making their way deeper the adventurers found the cursed blade they were looking for and a faceless knight named Ser Galeron. They defeated the knight in combat and Vyndrel claimed the cursed blade, Damakos claimed one of Ser Galeron's mimic companions; Vsid, Flint claimed what the Ser Galeron called: "My Salvation"; an amulet infused with magical light. They subsiquently returned the citadel... 

After a moment of rest and healing the adventurers resumed their questing; beginning with a delve into the depths of the citadel's Order meetinghouse. Damakos the Avenger led the delve, searching for any information pertaining to his father and nemesis: Scythan Reijin. Vyndrel discovered while they were delving that an ancient curse passed down through his bloodline has resurfaced. The adventurers learned that the cultists of the Order will be holding a meeting in the forest the following night... 

Damakos attempted to sneak out during the night but woke up the entire party. He then proceeded to convince them to stay at the guild while he "took a walk". Damakos set out and found the cultists summoning copper demons. He used his devilish appearance to infiltrate the demons and prepare a meeting the next day. The other adventurers recieved a profitable job from the syndicate and cautiously accepted a meeting. As the adventurers travelled to their meetings they discovered that Damakos would be meeting directly under the meeting place of the rest of the adventurers. Subsiquently Damakos' cover was blown by his comrades and they opened a demonic portal. An army of gilded soldiers then arrived and helped to dispatch the demons streaming from the portal... 

After fighting with the gilded soldiers the adventurers learned that the gold and green army was there to conquer the citadel for their false god; a false Apollo. The adventurers prepared to defend the citadel against the gilded forces when crystalline knights fell from the skies and decimated the golden army, pushing them back to the woods. The adventurers then returned to their guild, recovering the cultist's bodies, and Red ,with Vyndrel, experimented with magical infusion into matter. Red then slept on the cellar ceiling while researching. The three others couldn't find Red in the morning and proceeded to join a temporary army, battle a fragmented legion, and descend into a frostwyrm's lair and slew it, taking its head, notpiss and other parts. Red met with some of the mercenaries in the citadel while they were away. Upon the adventurer's return ᛋᛈᚺᛁᚾᚼ used the dragon's breath gland to make an exceptional cocktail. They then recieved a letter from Vyndrel's friend Xel... 

The adventurers were invited to the yearly "Dawnball", a gathering of the nobles in the citadel. After enjoying the pleasantries offered at the ball they connected with a variety of nobles over the banquet. After the banquet Damakos and Flint enacted a plan to steal a magical artifact from the gallery as they needed it to get to the desert where Scythan is found. Vyndrel got roped into dancing with the daughters of the emperor while Red got pulled to follow Ashriel by a strange magical distortion. Damakos grabbed the golden goblet, the artifact they needed, before he was pulled through his own darkness spell into the light by Singrel who proceeded to stab Damakos through the heart. Damakos' deity Apollo manifested to give Flint the power to heal Damakos. Singrel then threw Damakos' own sword at Apollo before diving to impale Apollo's leg with his runeblade, previously retrieved by Vyndrel, and was subiquently slammed to the ground by Damakos and disappeared in a blue light. Damakos was then chased from Ravenslight manor while Flint snuck back to Vyndrel... 
Red entered a side room with Ashriel to find a strange device made from arcane silver that negated his magic, after a bloody but brief struggle he was overpowered by the demonic creature Ashriel who proceeded to drink Red's blood. Vyndrel and Flint fought through the hallway outside of the room before breaking in to grab Red and leap from the stained glass window. Following battles in the streets, Damakos invoked his father's "gifts" and frightened off a battalion before meeting up with the others and fleeing the city as shatterguards fell from the sky, Vyndrel vowed vengance against Ashriel, Red vowed destruction on the citadel and the adventurers fled into the Dust Gap...
