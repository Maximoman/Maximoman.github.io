<p>Welcome to the homepage, I will possibly put notes here for future referance.</p>
<p>The creation of the Sonorous Realm is described by an ancient tablet and I copied it below.</p>
<p>It all began with a word, a beat, a sound. This sound spread far and wide upon empty space until it hit the gray sea, a place of desperation and loneliness. It flew across the sea to a land of color and feeling before finally failing and falling silent. Soon after, more sounds came from across the sea, and from whence they came new creatures were born. These creatures were born of not color or smell, but of sound, beats, strums and squeaks. These sounds quickly developed into a symphony of creation, they became visible to the beings who lived there and the basis of life. Sound became weapons and armors, detection, and substance. The strange evolution of this land took hold for centuries. But this is a story of what happened on the seventeenth day of the fifth month in the two thousand and nineteenth year. This is the story, of a champion.</p>
<p>The Sonorous Realm, as this plane is called, is in a very strange position in relation to others: it sits in the fabric of space and is only reachable by way of resonant portals formed by coalesced sound from surrounding planes, this makes access to the sonorous plane sporadic and unreliable. Another strange factor of the plane is that it's direction in time in relation to the rest of existence is maliable, allowing many strange events to occur such as heros saving a time before they were born and also leads to unpredictable consequences.</p>
